IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ:

This folder ([Solution]/PenLight/Jars) should contain the 'pen-v4.1.2_light.aar' Java archive file that is shipped
with the Samsung Galaxy Pen (a.k.a. S-Pen) SDK that is available for download from here:
http://developer.samsung.com/galaxy/pen

However, I don't want to distribute Samsung's proprietary software so that file is not included in this
code repository.

Just follow the link shown above and download the Pen SDK (version 4.1.2 from Oct 27 2016). Unzip the archive
and you should find the file listed above in the Libs folder.  Copy it into the Jars folder in this project and 
the project should build.
